            <p class="text-muted">
              The movie "Everything Everywhere All At Once" is surreal and
              absurd. While the film's plot and themes are complex and
              multi-layered, the metaphor of the internet as a multiverse made
              me reflect on my relationship with social media. Just as Maureen
              (the main character) can easily navigate between portals and
              worlds, we too can easily navigate between different websites and
              social media platforms. However, just as Maureen's travels between
              these worlds have consequences,
              <strong
                >our constant consumption of online content can have negative
                effects on our productivity and mental health.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
              As a result, I made the decision to take a break from social
              media, two months have passed. During this time, I focused on
              other activities, such as reading, writing, and improving my
              Front-end knowledge. I found that without the constant distraction
              of social media, I was able to focus more on my work and my
              relationships, and I felt more present in the moment.

            <h3>A Journey from Marketing to Technology</h3>
            <p>February.1.2022</p>
            <p class="text-muted">
              After 8 years of experience in marketing, I have decided to take
              on a new challenge and make a career switch to web development.
              It's both exciting and scary to embark on this new journey, but I
              believe that my background will bring a unique perspective and set
              of skills to the tech industry. As a marketer, I have seen
              firsthand the importance of bridging the gap between the
              technology and marketing/sales teams. I have experienced the
              frustration of miscommunication, conflicting priorities, and the
              struggle to effectively integrate marketing initiatives with
              technical capabilities. I am eager to use my skills and experience
              to build better relationships between the technology and marketing
              teams, leading to more effective and efficient collaboration. I
              can't wait to see what the future holds for me in this exciting
              new journey.

            <h3>Becoming a Front-End Developer: Learning React</h3>
            <p>January.18.2022</p>
            <p class="text-muted">
              As I embark on my journey to become a front-end developer,
              recently, I have been diving into the world of React, a JavaScript
              library for building user interfaces. React is one of the most
              popular front-end development frameworks in use today, and for
              good reason. It makes it easy to create complex and dynamic user
              interfaces, and allows for efficient updates and re-rendering of
              components. Stay tuned To see the new version of my weather app
              developed with React.

            <p class="text-muted">
              I am currently working on a project that involves creating a
              playlist based on colors and emotions. The first playlist is
              called "Yellow" and is meant to be a collection of songs that
              inspire creativity and joy. I have carefully selected each song on
              the playlist to reflect the bright and sunny energy of the color
              yellow. Whether you are working on a creative project, feeling
              down, or just need a little pick-me-up, I believe that this
              playlist will be the perfect companion.
